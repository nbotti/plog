# Plog

Inspired by [philipcmonk](https://github.com/philipcmonk/plogging)

A highly flexible personal logging platform that will accept basically anything you throw at it. Idea is to eventually have the interface learn to be more helpful by learning from previous log entries

To run:
```
cd <path>/plog
npm install
npm start
```
